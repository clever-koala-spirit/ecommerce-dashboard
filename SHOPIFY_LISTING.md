## Full Description

### The Problem You're Facing

You're running a successful DTC brand—but here's the gap: your Shopify dashboard shows revenue, your ad platforms show spend, your accounting software shows costs, and your email platform shows engagement. None of them talk to each other.

You're making decisions on incomplete data. You're scaling channels that *look* profitable but actually bleed margin. You're missing the patterns that separate 6-figure stores from 7-figure ones.

Competitors charge $129–$2,790/month for this visibility. That's $1,500–$33,000 a year just to understand your own business.

### The Slay Season Solution

Slay Season is your command center for ecommerce truth. We pull data from every channel that matters—Shopify, Meta Ads, Google Ads, Klaviyo, GA4—and build a unified analytics engine that actually answers the questions keeping you up at night:

- **What's my true profit margin, by channel?** (Not just revenue—actual COGS-adjusted margins)
- **Which customer cohorts drive repeat revenue?** (Identify your real MVPs)
- **Where should I invest next?** (AI forecasting shows which channels are inflection points)
- **What's my churn risk?** (Catch declining trends before they snowball)
- **Am I on track to hit my targets?** (Real-time forecasting vs. monthly guess-and-check)
